This repository contains Python scripts for basic image processing using OpenCV. The scripts were developed as part of a free OpenCV course, and the repository will be updated as I progress through the modules.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.8+** - Core programming language
- **OpenCV (cv2)** - Computer vision operations
- **NumPy** - Array manipulations and mathematical operations
- **Matplotlib** - Image visualization and plotting

## 📌 Topics Covered  

### 1️⃣ Loading and Displaying Images  
- Reading grayscale (`cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE`) and color (`cv2.IMREAD_COLOR`) images  
- Displaying images using `matplotlib` with proper RGB conversion  

### 2️⃣ Working with Color Images  
- Understanding BGR vs. RGB color formats  
- Converting between color spaces using `cv2.cvtColor()`  

### 3️⃣ Splitting and Merging Color Channels  
- Extracting R, G, B channels with `cv2.split()`  
- Reconstructing images with `cv2.merge()`  
- Visualizing individual color channels  

### 4️⃣ Converting Color Spaces  
- HSV and LAB color space conversions  
- Practical applications of different color spaces  

### 5️⃣ Cropping Images  
- Array slicing techniques for region extraction  
- Selective pixel manipulation

### 6⃣ Resizing Images

- Scaling images while maintaining aspect ratio
- Resizing using exact dimensions
- Choosing appropriate interpolation methods

### 7⃣ Saving Images
- Exporting processed images using `cv2.imwrite()`

### 8⃣ Flipping Images
- Flipping images horizontally, vertically, and both directions
